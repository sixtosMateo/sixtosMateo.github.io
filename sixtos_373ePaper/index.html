          <p>In these pages, I will explore the ethical issues relating to the innovations that create threats to recording industry. A lot of music listeners are finding new alternatives to access songs from their favorite music artist. These customers are taking advantage of the breakthrough of the illegal distribution copied music files.  Having this in mind, I will talk about some ethical issues that include the price fixing that well-known record labels do. In addition who is to blame for downloading piracy music files: the people who download or the people who created the tools to make this accessible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I am interested in this issue due to the fact that I am a big fan of music and supporter of some music artist. In order for music artists to become a success a lot of people need to have access to his or her music. Technology has made the distribution of music files quick and efficient which can be a double edge sword. If the quality of the content of any artist grabs the attention of a lot people then there is potential chance of profit. The reason why this issue is important to everyone is because there are a lot of fans of different music genres and smaller music artists who want to be heard. </p>
