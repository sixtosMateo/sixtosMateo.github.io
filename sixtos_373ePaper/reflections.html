          <p>As a fan of music, I had strong views about music piracy with certain artists. I believe that the quality of lyrics from an artist determines whether I would support him or her. To state that an artist is my favorite artist the quality of the content has to be consistent. If an artist release a new album I would definitely purchase it. In this case, I would not be in favor of music piracy because I want people to support my favorite artist so that he or she continues to create new albums.  If I consider an artist to be average and he or she releases a new album, I would probably try and get it for free and probably be for music piracy. Since there are different scenarios where I would change my mind about music piracy there is elasticity on my opinion. </p><p>
	As reading articles about music piracy and artists’ opinion about it I got both side of the issue. Some artists are for it because that is how they got their fame from. Those artists, normally, understand that some fans can’t purchase their albums. In order words, they create their music for the people not for the money.  To add on, those artists don’t worry about losing money in selling albums because they get profit from other means for example tours. Other artists are against music piracy because they do not get paid for their art and hard work. Some artists consider sharing music files as stealing; therefore, not making ethical right. In addition, they believe that it makes it harder for young music artists to make it big. </p><p>
	Technology grows and improves as time goes on. These innovating ideas are making music piracy seem as a normal thing. Online music services are becoming more noticeable that eventually music piracy will not be an issue. The future determines that profit will come from performances and not selling music, therefore another reason why music piracy is nothing to worry about. This being said I was able to come to a conclusion that music piracy should be officially a “normal thing” and there shouldn’t be consequences for accessing music files for free is the artist is okay with. A policy change that should be made is that music piracy should be allowed only if the owner of the product or content gives consents to the public or to a company.</p>
