Discussion
After describing the ethics within the music piracy I came up with three questions for my peers to answer. The following questions are:
          </p>
 <p>
If you were an artist who was barely starting a career what would your stand be on music piracy? What ethical framework would you use to explain your stand?
Responses:
     </p>
          <p>
One peer said that if he would be against music piracy. He used Egoism as an ethical framework because he is making music to get a paid. He said think about it as a job.
    </p>
<p>
Another response was that he was for it because if your music is good quality you would have fans that would support you by buying you music. Not only that the spread of the music would make him known. He mentioned that hedonism would be best fit for his explanation. 
Another person mentioned that artist themselves are fans of music. Therefore she would want to share her music so that fans can connect to her. Hedonism would describe her explanation because she wants the pleasure and satisfaction to touch people live with her music.
The last response was that she would used egoism because it is in her self interest to make music for the fans but at the same time it is her self interest to get paid for it as well.
          </p>

        <p>
If you became a famous artist because you integrated your feelings of certain events from your past would you use hedonism as an ethical choice to give music for free? Why or why not?
Response:
            </p>
          <p>
One person said that she wouldn’t because at the end of the day you need money to make more music and to pay bill.
</p>
          <p>
One girl said that even though you got famous out of your past to connect with your fans it is yours emotion and passion therefore you should get paid for it.
        </p>
          <p>
One person said that she would give some songs for free but make exclusive albums for sale because she still wants to get paid but give her fans a taste of it.
        </p>        
	<p>
If you knew that your favorite artist was in the merge of being broke and release a new album would you prefer to buy it or get it for free? How is it different if he or she was financially stable?
	Response:
        </p><p>
		One of my peer said that he would buy it because he wanted to support so that he can keep creating music. He also mentioned that it was a give and take relationship. The artist gets paid and he gets music he likes to go with his day. If the artist is financial stable He would still buy it because if he people don’t support then that is why he was broke in the first place.</p><p>
	One person said that it all depend whether he had money to buy it or not. There is elasticity in his decision because if the album isn’t good then he is not going to buy it. Regardless if that is he’s favorite album. He said that if he was financially stable and making money in other means then him getting it for free would not affect him.</p>
