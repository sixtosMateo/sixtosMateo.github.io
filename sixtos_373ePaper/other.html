<!--    set a link  for the court case-->
    
    The ambivalence between the music industry and the Internet was established coming into the 21st century when the band Metallica decided to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98767&page=1">sue</a> Napster for copyrights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica_v._Napster,_Inc.">infringement</a>. Metallica was able to trace the leak of a song that was supposed to be release in a movie but was played in the radio before the movie was shown to the public.  Naspter (a peer to peer file sharing software company) was responsible for this leak. In addition, it was proven that Naspter had a catalog of all songs the band had ever created. In Metallica, et al. v. Napster, Inc. court case, the judge ruling was that Napster was supposed to pay a fine for every song that was downloaded through its network. Furthermore, Naspter had to banned every user that had ever downloaded a song related to Metallica causing it to lose thousands of users. Napster came into a deal to filter songs for every artist that did not want their music to be downloaded within its network.</p><p>
          Later in the years,<a href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paul-stanley-says-illegal-music-downloading-is-morally-and-ethically-wrong-and-it-hurts-people/"> Paul Stanley</a>, another famous rock singer, spoke about file sharing. Stanley believes that file sharing is ethically and morally wrong. He states that file sharing is another word phrase for stealing. He compare this with the analogy of transportation borrowing would translate as stealing a car. He goes off by saying that when sharing music files that does not belong to you can hurt young artists who are trying to start a career. He agrees that there are other means to make profit but that should not be an excuse to steal intellectual property.
          </p><p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100524/0032549541.shtml">Lady Gaga</a>, a well-known artist, encourages for her followers to download her music illegally. Lady Gaga got her popularity by the method of free music. She states that she is okay with her followers to access her music in illegal forms because she makes profit out other means. For example, she gets her revenue from sold out tours and corporate sponsorship. She continues by stating that an artist can earn up to 40 million dollars of a two-year cycle of touring, but a famous artist can win up to 80 million dollars. The reason behind all of this is that she dislike artist that treat their fans like means rather than ends by throwing albums for their fans to purchase them. 
          Its been stated that music piracy has been reduced due to online music services. Online music services, like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and etc., are platforms where it continuously streams real time data. These services does not required any downloading of some sort and allows you to listen to any song that are stored on the app's database. Artists see these online music services as degrading to the music industry and more importantly to their personal music. On the other hand, other people see these services as new alternatives to making revenue and an approach to reducing piracy.</p><p>
          A young artist named <a href="http://time.com/3554468/why-taylor-swift-spotify/">Taylor Swift</a> had her music on Spotify until she decided to remove all her music from it. Her reasoning behind her decision was based that Spotify was degrading her music. She believes that the value of music is established by the dedication and passion that one devotes to it. In addition, the price of the album is based on what the artists and label decides to set into the market. Swift states that music is rare art, which is valuable; therefore, no artist should undervalue his or her art. Even though, Swift was making a good amount of money on Spotify, being number one listened artist, she still would not consider on going back to the company. She wants to send a message to young girls to find their value and not be afraid to ask for it. </p><p>
    Research has been done for online music services and data had been recorded that demonstrates that these services can reduce piracy and increase revenue. Data has shown the growth of users sign up for there online services. Spotify was founded on the year of 2006. From the years of 2012 through 2015 the total amount of users has quadruple. Users have even upgraded to premium and have increased paid users by a factor of 5. By the end of 2014, the overall paid users were 15 million, which help the increase of global users to 60 million by early 2015. Artist are earning about an average of .0006 for each song that it is streaming and about 70 percent of earnings that spotify earns from them. This is a lot of money for music to be undervaluing when having music on online music services. Since music is accessible and store in one place at a cheaper price people's motivation of pirating music has decreased. 
Online services are getting more complex as artists want to be part of this. This complexity is starting to encourage people to pirate music again. The complexity is that some online music services are making exclusive artist and some artist are opting out. Gathering music into one location is getting harder and users are having terrible experience with these services. Also, having more than one these online music service can get expensive, therefore defeating the purpose these companies. All these factors can be the up rise of music piracy.
