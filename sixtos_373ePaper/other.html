<!--    set a link  for the court case-->
    
    The ambivalence between the music industry and the Internet was established coming into the 21st century when the band Metallica decided to sue Napster for copyrights infringement. Metallica was able to trace the leak of a song that was supposed to be release in a movie but was played in the radio before the movie was shown to the public.  Naspter (a peer to peer file sharing software company) was responsible for this leak. In addition, it was proven that Naspter had a catalog of all songs the band had ever created. In Metallica, et al. v. Napster, Inc. court case,  the judge ruling was that Napster was supposed to pay a fine for every song that was downloaded through its network. Furthermore, Naspter had to banned every user that had ever downloaded a song related to Metallica causing it to lose thousands of users. Napster came into a deal to filter songs for every artist that did not want their music to be downloaded within its network.

<!--    paul stanley article-->
    Later in the years , Paul Stanley, another famous rock singer, spoke about file sharing. Stanley believes that file sharing is ethically and morally wrong. He states that file sharing is another word phrase for stealing. He compare this with the analogy of transportation borrowing would translate as stealing a car. He goes off by saying that when sharing music files that does not belong to you can hurt young artists who are trying to start a career. He agrees that there are other means to make profit but that should not be an excuse to steal intellectual property.
