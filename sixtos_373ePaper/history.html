    define piracy and the infringement laws
    
    In the early stages of the music industry, piracy was not a concerned. The consequences would outweigh the benefits. At the time is was difficult to access the music files which required technological expertise. As soon as music got digitalize the whole spectrum changed. Piracy began to attract a lot of users since it required little to no technology knowledge, inexpensive material and the quality if the product improved. Companies and developers started to focus on confronting this problem to boost profit.

    comment what is naspter 
    
    From 1999 to 2001, the first and most popular file sharing tool was the peer to peer file sharing. It was known for the unlimited downloads of music and the economic cost which was nothing. Napster was an online services that emphasized the sharing of digital audio files using Peer to Peer system. Naspter was common among users due the user friendly interface and realibility since the system never cashed. Naspter at the time had over 25 users and more than 80 million songs untll they were shut down due to infringement lawsuits. Naspter lost the case because of the Digital Millennium Copy Right Act. This act was the first blow to digital piracy by the music industry. However, users and pirates started to use other means in order to access the free music. Torrenting sites are legal to stay open since they are not hosting the actual copyright material. They are hosting sort go map which informs users where to go. Shutting down Naspter did not decreased pirating, on the contrary, it sparks a trend of new innovation ideas to access illegal audio files.

    In attempt to decreased new innovation ideas of accessing music files illegally new measures had to take into place. One development was the Digital Right Management System (DRMS) which aimed to protect digitally saved audio files from illegal sharing via the internet. Some appoaches from DRMS were encryptions, authorization definition languages and waterwarks. The purpose of these security restrictions were tp regulate the access and usage of the digital content. The downside of so many restrictions is that users would get discourage from using this as a method of requiring their music. Which would lead in drop of sales.
