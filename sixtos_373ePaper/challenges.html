          <p>As time passes, the competiveness of the music industry stimulates new innovative technologies, new platforms and new artist that want to be at the top. According to Meyer, in <a href="https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/175-the-future-of-the-music-industry">“The Future of the Music Industry,”</a> he states that the streaming technologies expand and improve as time continues. Therefore, the value of selling music will decrease, and the value of performing will increase. In the United States of America, 90 percent of the population has possession of a phone or tablet. These mobile devices are going to be a great factor to the increase of profits. Phone and tablets can sustain mobile applications (apps). These apps store data that help labels and artists to understand their audience. Analyzing data streaming, can help labels with marketing, promotional efforts, tours plans and dates for social demographics. Furthermore, not only can streaming services increase profits in performance, but it can also lower the usage of piracy, as people are intrigued with these online music services. </p><p>
          Trends of new tools to listen or access music are encouraging music listeners to purchase music since it is fast and efficient. In <a href="http://panmore.com/future-of-music-industry"> “The Future of Music Industry”</a>, Thompson states “The global distribution of music is likely to expand to include more online bookstores in the future. These online bookstores allow patrons to purchase music directly. These online bookstores are increasingly popular.” For people that like to support their favorite artist these tools is beneficial to them. </p>
