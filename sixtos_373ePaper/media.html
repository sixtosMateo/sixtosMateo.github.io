    The majority of news articles seem to look bad upon music piracy. For example in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-state-of-stealing-music-20150620-story.html">“Music Piracy is down but still very much,”</a> Faughnder states “music industry is still trying to recover from piracy's heyday. Last year, total music industry revenue was about $15 billion worldwide, well below the 1999 peak of $38 billion.” This seems bad for business as apple considers music piracy as competition for their streaming music services development and deployment. In <a href="http://piracy.americanassembly.org/copy-culture-report/attitudes/">“What Is Reasonable?”</a> there was a study that demonstrates people opinion about music piracy/music file sharing of different nations. It states “Few Americans with music files think it is “reasonable” to upload copies to websites where anyone can download them (15%), post links to “pirated copies” on websites such as Facebook (10%), or sell unauthorized copies (4%). Overall numbers are similar for TV/movies but differ in the age distribution. Significantly younger people (18–29) view sharing, uploading, and linking to TV/movie files as reasonable—especially uploading (24%) and linking to unauthorized videos (22%). ” The results show that less than half think that it is okay to share files in general even though some of them got their files from a hosting website.</p>
