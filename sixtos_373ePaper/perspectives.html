              Music is a consumer good that is sold to the fans; therefore being part of the economy. For any consumer good that is creating profit there will be small group of people receiving revenue. This is <a href="http://www.worldsocialism.org/english/what-capitalism">capitalism</a>. In the economy there is free market where competition is the major reason to lowering prices. In the music industry, there is a lot of competition that makes it hard for music artist to be known. Technology has helped artists to make it big. On the other hand, technology is hurting the established artists. For that reason, well-known artist are not okay with music piracy, for example Paul Stanley, Eminem and others. From their point of view, they have bills to pay and a family to take care of. Music piracy is not helping them. The ethical reasoning for not being okay using technology to illegally download music is capitalism. We live in a world where if you don't get paid you don't get to eat. On the contraire, other artists like Lady Gaga, who is okay with using technology to access music for a cheaper price or free, made it big by making profit out of other means.  </p><p> 
          So this goes on with the ethical framework Egoism. According to Moseley, in <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/egoism/">"Egoism"</a> he defines the word, as a theory that one's self should be the only motivation for one's action. An artist that thinks similarly to this ethical framework is Taylor Swift. In her interview in "Hereâ€™s Why Taylor Swift Pulled Her Music From Spotify" she states that having her music in Spotify downgrades her music. She views music as rare art and that labels should establish the prices. Her music is for her own beneficial gain. She shows this when she stated that she is trying to teach young girls to work hard and not be afraid to ask for their worth. She is setting a price for something that she works hard for. She feels that her work is not being appreciated when people access her music for free. </p><p>
          Music Piracy seems to be an unmoral and unethical crime. The problem is that labels from famous artist are over pricing music. This is why online music services were created. Artists are getting paid and people get music at a cheaper price. However, online music services are a customer good therefore capitalism is a default. This makes it harder to access music due to higher rates and exclusive artist causing music piracy to increase. So the ethical frameworks that can be apply here is hedonism. According to Weijers, in <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/hedonism/">"Hedonism"</a> hedonism means a theory where pleasure and pain is the main elements of whatever phenomena they are designed to describe. Some artists had tough lives with life events that scare them for live. They implement their feelings into their music. This causes a connection between artists and fans because fans can relate to the situation. If the music was meant for the fans then music should be free. This works vice versa if the artist made it big and is feeling in a good mood. Music makes fans feel some type of way; therefore, hedonism should be the motive for music to be cheaper or free. Thus, making music piracy ethically acceptable.
